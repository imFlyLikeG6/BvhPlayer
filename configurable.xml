<!--
  Enumerates all available channels from the Motion Service configurable data
  stream. It is not required to enumerate all channels in your client
  definition. The hierarchy in this example file illustrates which channels are
  activated by which parent node.

  The <all> node denotes that all child channels are enabled. Its children,
  <preview>, <sensor>, and <raw> in turn denote that all child channels are
  enabled.

  <Gq> enables <Gqw>, <Gqx>, <Gqy>, and <Gqz>

  All real valued elements specified in IEEE-754 single precision binary
  floating point format (binary32), little-endian byte order.

  All integral value elements specified in 16-bit signed integer two's
  complement format (short), little endian byte order.

 Root element with preferences defined as attributes.

 stride:   Skip frames to slow data rate handled by client. For example,
           set stride="2" to halve the frame rate exported to the client.

 full:     Full data stream read direct from hardware device to client. Set
           to "1" to enable full mode. The default data stream will drop
           samples if the client falls behind to preserve the hardware
           connection.

 inactive: Read back data for all nodes in the configuration, even if they are
           not associated with an actual sensor. Set to "1" to enable inactive
           mode. This is intended for clients that want to access interpolated
           node orientations or positions for every node.
